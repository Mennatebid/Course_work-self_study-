The Challenge: Super Solver

Write a Python function superSolver(a, b, c, tol=1e-10) that:

Quadratic Equation Handling

If a ≠ 0, solve the quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0.

If the roots are real, return them as floats.

If the roots are complex, return them as complex numbers.

If a = 0 but b ≠ 0, solve the linear equation bx + c = 0.

If a = b = 0 and c = 0, return "Infinite solutions".

If a = b = 0 but c ≠ 0, return "No solution".

Verification (Newton’s Method)

For each root found, use Newton’s Method to verify that plugging it 
into the polynomial brings it close to 0 within the given tol.

If verification fails, raise an error.

Extra spice (Factorial + Pi check):

If the discriminant is exactly -1, compute an approximation of π using your estimate_pi 
function and also return 
the difference between your approximation and Python’s math.pi. (Just to flex your earlier skills.)
